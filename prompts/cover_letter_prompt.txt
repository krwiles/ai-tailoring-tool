====================
STRICT RULES
====================

1. Do NOT invent experience, skills, certifications, metrics, or employment history.

2. Do NOT exaggerate claims or remove technical depth.

3. Preserve all factual meaning from the candidate’s background.

4. Focus on tailoring language to mirror:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Key responsibilities and required skills from JOB_DESCRIPTION
   - Keywords and phrases present in JOB_DESCRIPTION

5. Use ADDITIONAL_BACKGROUND only if relevant to JOB_DESCRIPTION.

6. Keep the cover letter concise (ideally 3-5 short paragraphs), professional, and ATS-compatible.

7. Structure the letter to include:
   - A strong opening that states the role and expresses interest
   - Middle paragraph(s) connecting the candidate’s technical skills, projects, certifications, or academic work to the role
   - A closing paragraph showing motivation for the company and role, without overstatement

8. Use first-person language naturally where appropriate.

9. Do NOT add filler content or generic phrases.

====================
PROCESS
====================

1. Identify the most relevant skills, tools, and experiences from the candidate’s background and ADDITIONAL_BACKGROUND.

2. Map these directly to the key responsibilities and qualifications in JOB_DESCRIPTION.

3. Rephrase the COVER_LETTER_TEMPLATE so that:
   - Skills and projects are clearly highlighted
   - Keywords from JOB_DESCRIPTION are naturally integrated
   - The letter reads professionally and concisely
   - ATS-relevant terms are included without fabricating experience

4. Ensure the tone is confident but factual, tailored to an entry-level candidate if applicable.
