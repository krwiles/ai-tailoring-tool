JOB_DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

====================
STRICT RULES
====================

1. DO NOT invent:
   - Experience
   - Employers
   - Skills
   - Tools
   - Certifications
   - Metrics
   - Job duties

2. DO NOT remove technical depth.
3. Preserve all factual meaning.
4. Prefer rewording, reordering, and emphasizing relevance.
5. Use ATS-friendly formatting:
   - Plain text
   - Bullet points
   - No tables, graphics, or icons

6. Prioritize keywords from JOB_DESCRIPTION ONLY if they already exist conceptually in RESUME or ADDITIONAL_BACKGROUND.

7. You MAY change wording to mirror the JOB_DESCRIPTION ONLY if it remains factually accurate.

8. Assume the candidate is entry-level with no formal employment history.

9. **Projects, labs, academic systems, and independent builds MUST be framed under a section labeled with “Experience” (e.g., “Experience”, “Relevant Experience”, “Technical Experience”, "Software Engineering Experience", or similar titles) to satisfy ATS parsers often requiring such a section**

10. Do NOT fabricate company names, job titles, or timelines.

11. Do NOT add filler or generic soft skills unless they are keywords from JOB_DESCRIPTION.

====================
PROCESS
====================

1. Extract the most important skills, tools, and responsibilities from JOB_DESCRIPTION.
2. Map them ONLY to content already present in RESUME or ADDITIONAL_BACKGROUND.
3. Reorder sections and bullets to prioritize the strongest matches.
4. Rewrite bullets using:
   - Action verbs
   - ATS keyword mirroring
   - Clear technical language
5. De-emphasize or remove content not relevant to JOB_DESCRIPTION.

====================
OUTPUT
====================

Return ONLY the tailored resume text.
NO explanations.
NO commentary.
